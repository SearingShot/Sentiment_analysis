# Sentiment_analysis
## Introduction
- Sentiment Analysis using VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) Module, RoBERTa(Robustly Optimized BERT Approach) Model and ü§ó Transformer, is Done On The Dataset Of Amazon Reviews.
- After Doing the Analysis We will be Comparing Them , to see How Accurate The Results are.
- VADER( Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning) is an NLTK module that provides sentiment scores based on the words used. It Generally uses bag of Words Approach.
- RoBERTa (short for ‚ÄúRobustly Optimized BERT Approach‚Äù) is a variant of the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model,  which was developed by researchers at Facebook AI. 
- ü§ó (Hugging Face) Transformers is an open-source framework for deep learning created by Hugging Face. It provides APIs and tools to download state-of-the-art pre-trained models and further tune them to maximize performance.
